# DREAD Calc

## What is DREAD Calc?

DREAD Calc is a web based tool that can be used to complete a risk assessment following the DREAD model. It's written in Python using the Flask web framework.


## What is DREAD?

DREAD is a risk assessment model. It's made up of 5 components:
- Damage: How much damage could an attack cause.
- Reproducibility: How easily can the same attack be repeated.
- Exploitability: How difficult is it to actually launch an attack.
- Affected Users: How many assets are affected by the attack.
- Discoverability: How easily can the vulnerability be discovered.

It was developed by Microsoft in 2002 and discontinued in 2008 due to the ratings being inconsistent and too subjective.

### Why develop DREAD Calc?

DREAD Calc is for educational purposes. I would also like to develop STRIDE Calc for the same purpose using the STRIDE model.
